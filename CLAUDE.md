# CLAUDE.md — RE Engine Modding Tool

Node-based modding tool for Capcom RE Engine games. First target: **Resident Evil 4 (2023), "RE4R"**.
Long-term: AI-assisted asset generation plus optional REFramework runtime features.
**Current scope: Milestone 1 (M1) only. No AI, no REFramework work.**

Source labels used below: **[official]** = official/authoritative docs, **[guide]** = community guide,
**[inferred]** = design decision or assumption from planning, **[TBD-spike]** = must be confirmed by a manual in-game test.

---

## 1. Hard rules

- Windows-first. Native desktop executable. **No web UI, no browser, no webview, no Python UI.**
- **The UI contains no logic.** All behavior lives in `core/`. The ImGui front end is expected to be
  replaced by a more polished native UI later; `core/` must not depend on ImGui or any UI library.
- Never commit game files. Gitignore at minimum: `natives/`, `*.tex.*`, `*.pak`, `*.mesh.*`, extraction caches.
- Never vendor third-party tools whose license does not allow redistribution (see §6).
- Do not add AI features during M1.
- Do not guess RE Engine format details. Unknowns go in §9 and are marked `[TBD-spike]`.
- Keep disk writes low: extract game PAKs **once** into a reusable cache; never re-extract per run.
  Keep log verbosity low by default.
- Keep working paths short (Windows 260-char path limit is a known problem for RE mods) [guide].

## 2. Stack [inferred — decided in planning]

- C++20, CMake, MSVC, vcpkg (manifest mode) for dependencies.
- UI (M1): Dear ImGui (docking branch) + imgui-node-editor (thedmd).
  - Pin both versions. Known docking-branch interaction bug, reportedly fixed:
    https://github.com/thedmd/imgui-node-editor/issues/230 [official]
- C++20, not 23: MSVC 14.50 has no stable `/std:c++23` (only preview `/std:c++latest`). Core reports
  errors with exceptions (no `std::expected` in C++20).
- Libraries, verified 2026-09-30 (maintained, permissive license, in vcpkg). Versions pinned via
  `vcpkg.json` builtin-baseline + overrides:
  - **Adopted:** toml++ 3.4.0 (MIT, profiles), Catch2 3.16.0 (BSL-1.0, tests),
    Dear ImGui 1.92.9 docking (MIT), imgui-node-editor 0.9.3#4 (MIT; upstream lightly maintained,
    last tag Oct 2023, vcpkg patches it for ImGui 1.92). Issue #230's fix (#205, commit 3fdb8e3) is in v0.9.3.
  - **Verified, deferred until needed:** nlohmann/json 3.12.0 (MIT; add when the manifest is serialized),
    nativefiledialog-extended 1.4.0 (Zlib; add with the first file dialog). GoogleTest not used.
- Build (Developer PowerShell for VS 2026, which sets `VCPKG_ROOT`):
  `cmake --preset default` → `cmake --build build` → `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`
- Long-term polished UI: undecided. Keep the core-to-UI boundary clean so it can be swapped.

## 3. Architecture

```
core/        Graph engine, node types, game profiles, tool wrappers, packaging. No UI deps.
cli/         Runs a saved graph headlessly. Used for tests and automation.
app/         ImGui front end. Thin layer over core/.
profiles/    Per-game data files (TOML). Adding a game = adding a profile, not code.
schemas/     Manifest + graph file schemas (versioned).
runtime/     (Later) REFramework Lua core + optional C++ plugin. Empty in M1.
tests/
docs/
```

### Output tiers
1. **Asset-only** — file replacements packaged for Fluffy Mod Manager. No REFramework. ← M1
2. **Scripted** — adds Lua; requires REFramework. (Later)
3. **Native** — adds C++ REFramework plugin (e.g. video playback). (Later)

The packager selects the lowest tier the graph needs and only declares an REFramework dependency for tier 2/3.

### Runtime design (later milestones, recorded now so M1 doesn't block it)
One generic runtime is shipped once; each mod ships **data only** (manifest + assets), not code.

## 4. Milestone 1 — definition of done

A streamlined pipeline, no AI:

1. **LoadTex** — game `.tex` → image + `TexMeta` (via Noesis).
2. **ExportImage / ImportImage** — write a PNG for external editing; read the edited PNG back.
3. **SaveTex** — image + `TexMeta` → `.tex` matching the original's dimensions/format (via Noesis;
   texconv fallback only if Noesis can't encode).
4. **PackageMod** — write `ModName/natives/STM/...` + `modinfo.ini` + screenshot → archive.

Done when:
- The graph runs from both the app and the CLI.
- One RE4R loading-screen/UI texture mod built by the tool loads correctly in game via Fluffy.
- Unit tests pass (§8).

First target is a 2D UI/loading-screen texture (no UV concerns). Character albedo textures come after M1.

## 5. Data contracts [inferred — v0, may evolve]

### TexMeta
```
source_path     original .tex path (relative to natives root)
game_profile    e.g. "re4r"
width, height
format          e.g. BC7 (read from the original, never assumed)
mip_count
array_count
```
SaveTex must reproduce the original's width/height/format/mips.

### Manifest v0
```json
{
  "schema_version": 0,
  "runtime_version": null,
  "game": "re4r",
  "tier": 1,
  "requires_reframework": false,
  "assets": [],
  "triggers": []
}
```
`triggers` stays empty until tier 2. `runtime_version` is null for tier 1.

### Game profile (profiles/re4r.toml)
```toml
[game]
id              = "re4r"
name            = "Resident Evil 4 (2023)"
tex_suffix      = "143221013"                 # [guide] RE4R texture version suffix
natives_root    = "natives/STM"               # [guide]
packaging       = ["loose_archive", "pak"]    # [TBD-spike] which Fluffy accepts for RE4R
pak_script      = "Create-PAK-2023.bat"       # [guide] REtool script for 2023-or-older games
noesis_export   = "TBD"                       # [TBD-spike] ?cmode option selecting RE4R tex output
file_list       = "TBD"                       # [TBD-spike] PAK file list source/version
```

## 6. External dependencies — "managed dependencies"

Bundle only what licensing allows; install or detect the rest on first run, with user consent.

| Tool | Role | License status | Handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Noesis | TEX ↔ image conversion | Freeware, no redistribution terms found | Don't bundle. Offer `winget install -e --id RichWhitehouse.Noesis`, or detect existing install |
| fmt_RE_MESH Noesis plugin | RE Engine format support | Fork checked had **no license file** (all rights reserved by default); original repo not checked | Don't bundle. Download from repo at setup with consent, into `Noesis/plugins/python` |
| REtool | PAK extraction / optional PAK creation | No license found | Don't bundle. Detect path; guide manual install |
| Fluffy Mod Manager | Install/test mods | No license found | Don't bundle. User selects path |
| texconv (DirectXTex) | Fallback DDS encoding | MIT [official] | May bundle, include license notice |
| REFramework | Tiers 2/3 only | Not checked | Not needed in M1. Detect via `dinput8.dll` in game dir [guide] |

Plugin note [official, plugin README]: it stores the extracted `re_chunk_000.pak` base directory per game
in a txt file next to the plugin — the tool must set/verify this.

## 7. Tool wrapper requirements [inferred]

- All external tools run as subprocesses with timeouts, captured stdout/stderr, and exit-code checks.
- Noesis command-line mode: `Noesis.exe ?cmode infile outfile -options` [official].
- Never assume a conversion succeeded: verify output exists and TexMeta matches.

## 8. Testing (no game required)

- Path mapping from game-relative paths to package paths.
- `modinfo.ini` contents and package folder layout.
- Profile loading/validation.
- Round-trip: original TEX → image → TEX reproduces the original's TexMeta and image data.
  Fixtures are **local only**, located via env var `REMOD_FIXTURES`. Tests skip if unset.
  Never commit fixture game files.

## 9. Open questions / spike results  [TBD-spike]

Fill these in from the manual spike before implementing the affected code:

- [ ] Does fmt_RE_MESH's RE4R tex export work under Noesis `?cmode`? Exact options?
- [ ] Does Noesis encode BC7 itself (making texconv unnecessary)?
- [ ] Target texture path used for the first mod: `natives/STM/...`
- [ ] Does Fluffy accept a loose-file archive for RE4R, or is a REtool-built PAK needed?
- [ ] PAK file list source for the current game version.
- [ ] RE4R game version the spike was done on.
- [ ] Does the RE4R `tex_suffix` (143221013) change across game updates?
- [ ] Archive format Fluffy expects for the packaged mod (zip/7z/rar), and folder depth inside it.
- [ ] Text encoding and line endings Fluffy expects in `modinfo.ini` (ASCII vs UTF-8; CRLF written for now).
      Format itself confirmed [guide]: flat lowercase `key=value`, fields name/version/description/author/
      screenshot (+ optional category/homepage), literal `\n` for line breaks in description.
- [ ] Screenshot size/aspect requirements for Fluffy, if any (formats: jpg/png/tga/bmp [guide]).
- [ ] Should a tier-1 package include `manifest.json`, or only tier 2/3?

## 10. Later milestones (do not start)

- M2: AI backend as a separate local process (not in the app). GPU/VRAM detection at install.
  img2img/ControlNet for textures, never plain text-to-image for UV-mapped textures.
- M3: REFramework Lua runtime reading manifests (triggers → actions).
- M4: C++ REFramework plugin for video playback (in-game "cutscene" videos).
- Replace ImGui front end with a polished native UI.
